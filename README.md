- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jonathan Cao, a recent graduate from California State University, Fullerton. I graduated with a degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Business Analytics.
- ðŸ‘€ I am currently looking for an opportunity to showcase my strong analytical skills in a full-time position, particularly as a data analyst, although I'm open to a variety of different roles.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently refining my skills in Microsoft Excel, Tableau, and SQL by working on individual projects. I am also learning how to code in Python in my free time!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: jonathancao38@gmail.com or (626)782-2079
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy being active in my free time, so I spend a lot of time playing basketball, volleyball, and running. I am also a huge music enjoyer, so I spend a lot of my free time (and money) going to concerts and discovering new music.
